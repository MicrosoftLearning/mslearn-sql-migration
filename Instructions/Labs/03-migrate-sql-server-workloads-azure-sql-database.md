## Connect to Azure SQL Database in Azure Data Studio

Before start using the Azure migration extension, let's connect to the target database.

1. Launch Azure Data Studio.

1. Select **Connections**, then **Add Connection**.

1. Fill out **Connection Details** with the SQL Server name and other information.

    > **Note**: Enter the name of the SQL Server created previously. The format should be in the format of **<server>.database.windows.net**.

## Install and launch the Azure migration extension for Azure Data Studio

Follow these steps to install the migration extension. If Azure migration extension is already installed, you can skip these steps.

1. Open the extensions manager in Azure Data Studio.

1. Search for ***Azure SQL Migration*** and select the extension.

1. Install the extension. Once you install it, the Azure SQL Migration extension is in the list of installed extensions.

1. Connect to a SQL Server instance in Azure Data Studio. In the new connection tab, select **Optional (False)** for the **Encrypt** option.

1. To launch the Azure migration extension, right-click on the source instance name and select **Manage** to access the dashboard and the landing page of the Azure SQL Migration extension.

    > **Note**: If the **Azure SQL Migration** option isn't visible in the dashboard side bar, reopen Azure Data Studio.
 
## Generate the database schema with DMA

Before we begin the migration, we need to make sure the schema exists at the target database. We use DMA to create the schema from the source and apply it to the target.

1. Launch Data Migration Assistant.

1. Create a new migration project, set the source type to **SQL Server**,  the target server type to **Azure SQL Database**, and migration scope to **Schema only**. Select **Create**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to initiate a new migration project on Data Migration Assistant.](../media/3-data-migration-schema.png) 

1. On the **Select source** tab, enter the name of the source SQL Server instance, and select the **Authentication type** supported by the source SQL Server instance. Select **Connect**. Make sure **Encrypt connection** is unchecked.

1. Select **AdventureWorksLT** database, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Select target** tab, enter the name of the source SQL Server instance, select **SQL Server Authentication** for **Authentication type**, and provide the SQL user credentials. 

1. Select **AdventureWorksLT** database, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Select objects** tab, select all schema objects from the source database. Select **Generate SQL script**. 

    ![Screenshot showing the select objects tab on Data Migration Assistant.](../media/3-data-migration-generate.png)

1. Once the schema has been generated, take some time to review it. This step involves making any necessary adjustments to the script for objects that cannot be created in their current state at the target location, which is not the case in this scenario.
 
1. You can execute the script manually using Azure Data Studio, SQL Management Studio, or by selecting **Deploy schema**. Proceed with one of the methods.

1. After the status is **Succeeded**, navigate to the target server, and validate the target database. Check the database schema and the migrated data.

You've learned how to install the migration extension, and generate the schema of the database using Data Migration Assistant. Youâ€™ve also learned how to migrate a SQL Server database to an Azure SQL Database using the Azure migration extension for Azure Data Studio. Once migration is complete, you can start using your new Azure SQL Database resource. 

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. 

Leaving resources running unnecessarily can result in extra costs. You can delete resources individually or delete the entire set of resources in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
