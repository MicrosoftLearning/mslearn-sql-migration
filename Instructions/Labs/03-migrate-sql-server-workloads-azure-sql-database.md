You've learned how to install the migration extension, and generate the schema of the database using Data Migration Assistant. Youâ€™ve also learned how to migrate a SQL Server database to an Azure SQL Database using the Azure migration extension for Azure Data Studio. Once migration is complete, you can start using your new Azure SQL Database resource. 

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. 

Leaving resources running unnecessarily can result in extra costs. You can delete resources individually or delete the entire set of resources in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
